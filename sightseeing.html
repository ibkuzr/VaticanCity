          <h2>St. Peter's Basilica</h2>
          <p>This is one of the holiest sights in the world, and no trip to Vatican City would be complete without taking in the majesty of this impressive Renaissance church. The basilica is said to be built upon the burial sight of Saint Peter, one of the twelve Apostles of Jesus Christ and the first Pope. Building began in 1506 under Pope Julius II and was completed in 1626 under Pope Urban VIII. Saint Peter’s Basilica is one of the largest Christian churches in the world and can accommodate 60,000 people. It is notable for its massive dome designed by Michelangelo — it is the tallest dome in the world — which can be visited and offers impressive views of Saint Peter’s square from up above. The church inside contains priceless works of art from the masters of the time including Raphael, Bramante, Michelangelo, and Bernini.</p>

          <h2>Vatican Museums</h2>
          <p>One of the largest museums in the world (and the 6th most visited museum in the world), the Vatican Museums are home to important classical sculptures and Renaissance masterpieces. They were founded by Pope Julius II in the 16th century, prompted by the discovery of the marble sculpture Lacoön and his Sons which was the first piece to be put on display. The more than 70,000 pieces on view span centuries of humanity, from ancient Egypt to modern times, in the Collection of Religious Modern Art. Highlights of the museum include the Hall of Maps, the rooms of Raphael (including the School of Athens), and of course, Michelangelo’s frescoed Sistine Chapel. Depicting The Last Judgement, it is the final room in the museum and its most impressive attraction.</p>

          <h2>St. Peter's Square</h2>
          <p>St. Peter's Square is the large plaza located directly in front of St. Peter's Basilica. Both the square and the basilica are named after Saint Peter, an apostle of Jesus and the first Catholic Pope. The open space was redesigned by Gian Lorenzo Bernini from 1656 to 1667, under the direction of Pope Alexander VII, as an appropriate forecourt, designed "so that the greatest number of people could see the Pope give his blessing, either from the middle of the façade of the church or from a window in the Vatican Palace". In the center of the square stands an Egyptian obelisk, 25.5 meters tall - 41 meters (135ft) including the pedestal. The obelisk was originally located at Heliopolis in Egypt and was built for Cornelius Gallus, the city's prefect. In 37 AD Caligula decided to transport the obelisk to Rome with a specially constructed ship. It was installed at the spina of the Circus of Caligula (later known as Circus of Nero), which was located in an area now occupied by Vatican City.</p>
